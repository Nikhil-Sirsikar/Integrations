## Salesforce Integration Overview

Salesforce integrations allow you to connect Salesforce with external systems and applications to share data and automate processes.

### Types of Integrations:
   - **API Integration:** Uses REST or SOAP APIs for connecting Salesforce with other systems.
   - **Middleware Tools:** Tools like Mulesoft or Boomi can be used for more complex integrations.
   - **AppExchange Apps:** Ready-made apps available on Salesforce's marketplace for easy setup.
   - **Outbound Messaging:** Sends data from Salesforce to external systems automatically.
   - **Salesforce Connect:** Access and interact with external data in real-time without storing it in Salesforce.

### Authentication:
   - **OAuth 2.0:** A secure authentication method commonly used.
   - **Username-Password:** A simpler but less secure authentication method.
   - **Connected Apps:** Used to manage external API access securely.

### Common Use Cases:
   - **ERP Integration:** Syncing Salesforce with ERP systems like SAP or Oracle.
   - **Marketing Integration:** Connecting with marketing tools like HubSpot or Marketo.
   - **Support Integration:** Linking Salesforce with customer service tools like Zendesk.

### Best Practices:
   - **Monitor API Limits:** Salesforce has daily limits on API usage.
   - **Error Handling:** Implement error logs and retry logic for failed transactions.
   - **Field Mapping:** Ensure that data fields are correctly mapped between systems.
